Instructions for use:

Start by running Main.java in src\mathpuzzle

Once in the program:

Use the mouse to click on any tile to select it.
The selected tile is highlighted in bright blue.

To make a move, press the arrow key on your keyboard
corresponding to the direction you'd like to move.
If the move you're trying to make is invalid, pressing
the arrow key will do nothing.

If you have lost, the message box in the bottom right will
inform you and tell you that you may reset the board.

If you win, the center tile will turn orange, and the
message box will inform you that you have won.

Press the "reset" button to reset the board to its starting state.
Press the "quit" button or use the Windows [X] button to 
close the app. A dialogue box will ask you to confirm you wish to quit.
